# CARD_HOVER_EFFECTS_&_GLOWING_GRADIENT

IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL BE MAKING HOW TO MAKE CARDS LOOKS MORE ATTRACTIVE BY SIMPLY USING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. THE STEPS TO CREATE ARE AS FOLLOWS :-
1) OPEN VS CODE.
2) COPY THE EXACT SAME HTML FILE, CSS FILE AND JAVASCRIPT FILE AS NUMBERED.
3) DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES AS TAKEN IN THE html, css or javascript CODE USING <img> TAG.
4) CLICK ON GO LIVE EXTENSION ON THE CORNER SIDE OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN.

A BROWSER WINDOW WILL OPEN WITH THE CARD DESIGN. ENJOY!!
